            What is the U.S. Interventions Model?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            The U.S. Interventions Model is a data platform that projects COVID
            infections, hospitalizations, and deaths across the United States,
            as well as models how public health interventions contain the spread
            of COVID and save lives. The U.S. Interventions Model is an SEIR
            model (a type of epidemiological model).
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="h6" component="h6">
            Wait, what‚Äôs an SEIR model?
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            SEIR is a way of modeling infection diseases. Simply put, it
            specifically models the flows of people between four states:
            susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and resistant (R):
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            Susceptible (S) ‚Üí ùõÉ ‚Üí Exposed (E) ‚Üí ùù® ‚Üí Infectious (I) ‚Üí ùö™ ‚Üí
            Recovered (R)
          </Typography>

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            Each of those variables represents the number of people in those
            groups. The parameters beta (ùõÉ), sigma (ùù®), and gamma (ùö™) control
            how fast people move from one state to another. Our model is
            significantly more complicated than this, and even this might sound
            complicated, but in a nutshell this is the modeling approach we use.
            Why did we choose an SEIR approach? SEIR models are widely used by
            epidemiologists to model disease outbreaks in both research and
            practical settings. Our model is adapted from a model{' '}

                Only a small fraction of the world has been infected. It‚Äôs a new

                There is no historical precedent for what is going on right now
                to draw from.
              </li>
              <li>
                The default R0 used in this model is an average. The model does
                not adjust for the population density, culturally-determined
                interaction frequency and closeness, humidity, etc. in
                calculating R0.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is not a node-based analysis and thus assumes everyone
                spreads the disease at the same rate. In practice, there are
                some folks who are ‚Äúsuper-spreaders,‚Äù and others who are almost
                isolated. Interventions should be targeted primarily at those
                most likely to spread the disease.
              </li>
              <li>
                Only hospital beds in aggregate are considered. ICU beds and
                ventilators, which are likely to run low before beds, are not
                considered.
              </li>
              <li>
                Demographics, populations, and hospital bed count data are
                outdated. Demographics for the U.S. as a whole are used, rather
                than specific to each state.
              </li>

              <li>
                In containment cases, we do not consider the longer-term impacts
                of maintaining containment; primarily, the reintroduction of
                COVID through travel. 14-day mandatory border quarantines, such
                as those currently in place in China, would likely need to be
                implemented until a vaccine or therapeutic is developed.
